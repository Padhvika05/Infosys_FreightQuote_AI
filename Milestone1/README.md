## **Milestone 1: User Authentication Module** 

This is my Milestone 1 submission — a complete authentication system built from scratch, not just a login form. It covers login, signup, and forgot password with two recovery routes, proper session handling with JWT, field validation, and two separate dashboards — one for a regular user and one for an admin. 

The whole thing runs inside a single Google Colab notebook. **Streamlit** powers the UI, the app runs as a background process, and **ngrok** exposes it through a public URL so it can be opened and tested in an actual browser instead of staying locked inside Colab. 

## **Features** 

|**Features**||
|---|---|
|**Feature**|**What it does**|
|**Login**|Validates email + password, shows one generic error on failure — never<br>reveals which field was wrong|
|**Signup**|Collects username, email, password, confirm password, security question &<br>answer — enforces uniqueness on username/email|
|**Forgot**<br>**Password**|Two recovery routes on one page — Security Question**or**OTP-by-email|
|**Field**|Email format check (ab@cd.ef shape) + strict password rule (8+ chars,|
|**Validation**|upper, lower, number, special symbol)|
|**JWT Sessions**|Token issued on login, verified before showing the dashboard, auto-expires<br>after 2 hours|
|**User**<br>**Dashboard**|Welcome banner, sample analytics cards, and a live system health gauge|
|**Admin**|Separate hard-coded admin login (not a signup account) — lists every|
|**Dashboard**|registered user's username & email,**never**passwords|
|**OTP Emails**|Sent via Gmail SMTP with an App Password, styled as a branded HTML<br>email instead of plain text|
|**Custom UI**<br>**Theme**|Consistent color palette and neo-brutalist styling applied across every page|



## **Tech Stack** 

**Layer** 

## **Tools Used** 

**Frontend / UI** Streamlit, streamlit-option-menu, Plotly 

**Backend / Auth** PyJWT, bcrypt 

**Database** SQLite **Email / OTP** smtplib, email.mime, email-validator **Deployment** pyngrok (public tunnel from Colab) **Secrets** Google Colab Secrets (userdata) 

**Security note:** Passwords and security answers are hashed with **bcrypt** before ever touching the database. Sensitive values — JWT secret, ngrok token, email credentials — are stored in **Colab Secrets** , never hard-coded in the notebook. 

## **How to Run** 

## **1. Set up your secrets** 

Open the notebook in Google Colab → click the **key icon** in the left sidebar → add these four secrets and toggle **notebook access ON** for each: 

**Secret Name Value** 

JWT_SECRET Any long random string 

NGROK_AUTHTOKEN Copied from your ngrok dashboard 

EMAIL_ADDRESS Gmail address that sends the OTPs EMAIL_PASSWORD A Gmail **App Password** (needs 2-Step Verification turned on first) 

## **2. Run the cells in order** 

- pip install cell 

- imports + secrets cell 

- database + helper functions cell 

- JWT + session management cell 

- %%writefile app.py cell 

- launcher cell (starts Streamlit + opens ngrok tunnel) 

## **3. Open the app** 

The last cell prints a public **ngrok URL** — open it in a new browser tab. 

## **4. Try it out** 

- Sign up a new account 

- Log in and check out the dashboard 

- Test **Forgot Password** with both the security question and OTP routes 

- Log in with the admin credentials to see the admin dashboard 

## **5. Shut it down** 

Interrupt the last cell (Ctrl+C or the Colab stop button) — it cleans up the ngrok tunnel and kills the Streamlit process automatically.
